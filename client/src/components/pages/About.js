            Welcome to sheltr, where you can connect with the newest furry addition to your home! We envision a world where
            the human-animal bond is accessible to everyone, and no animal is left in need. Please make an account with us, 
            take a look through the animals who are currently looking for homes, apply to adopt, or even leave a donation so
            we can continue to care for vulnerable animals and find them loving homes.
